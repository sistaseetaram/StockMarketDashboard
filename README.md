# StockMarketDashboard
Objective is to create a real time stock market dashboard.


## Task List
- [ ] Data Acquisition. 
  1. Sources for data - Yahoo Finance API, Stocktwit API.
- [ ] EDA
  1. Understanding the features and data using various statistical methods like <br/> moving average, Hypothesis tests, Computing confidence Intervals for population data etc.
- [ ] Data Vizualization 
  1. Box plots on opening and closing prices to show the spread of stock price on daily and monthly basis.
  2. Histograms and density plots to show the moving average or volatility in stock data.
  3. Density plots to show various features like price to earning ratio etc.
- [ ] First web dashboard with all the insights.
  1. Base web application to show all the above results using SreamLit and deploy Heroku.
- [ ] Preprcessing
  1. Dealing with volatility in data.
  2. Dealing with Outliers and missing data.
  3. Dealing with Imabalance in data.
  4. Scaling data.
- [ ] Model selection and Feature Engineering
  1. First, we select some simple linear models to set a benchmark for future model selection.
  2. Then check the feature importance and add more features by feature.
  3. And then experiment with the new features and decide the final set of features.
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning and Validation and finalizing the model.
  1. Now, Experiment with different models and tune their respective hyperparameters.
  2. Experiment with ensembles like Bagging, Boosting and Stacking techniques.(RF,GBDT)
  3. Finalize the model.
- [ ] Prediction on test data and performance check.
  1. Predict the resultsont test and real time data.
  2. Check performance by using appropriate metric.
- [ ] Prototype model deployment.
  1. Deploying the full functioning prototype.
- [ ] Scaling up the model by adding more features and data.
  1. Scale up the project by adding functionalities like
      1. Develop a sequence model(Deep Learning model) to achive the same task and check its performance.
      2. Natural Language Inference from current stock news by web scrapping the news data and then applying LSTM's and other state of the art techniques.
